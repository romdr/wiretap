TODO:
- PCH for viewer
- Make profiler lib config (would be nice to just include a .h without having to change project config when integrating to a project)
- Align functions/timings
- Display standard deviation line and text
- Horizontal scale tweakable (1 second by default, can zoom out)
- Mouse scroll / shift + mouse scroll to zoom in/out height and frames rendered
- Update m_WindowWidth/Height when resizing the window
- Redraw when regain focus, move window, resize
- Key to take screenshot
- Key to save entire dump
- Key to load dump
- Move colors to constants (default, later can override colors with config file)
- Handle multi-threading (at least thread id, one buffer/output per thread)
- Display stats: most expensive function, most expensive function taking into account the calls count, most variable function, etc.
- Linux compatibility (makefile, etc.)
- Python and C# port of the profiler api
